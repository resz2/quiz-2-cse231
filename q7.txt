Need matrix = Max - Allocated

    A   B   C   D
P0  2   2   1   1
P1  2   1   3   1
P2  0   2   1   3
P3  0   1   1   2
P4  2   2   3   3


Available vector : (initial state)

    A   B   C   D
    3   3   2   1


P0 is the only process whose needs can be met by the available resources,
so P0 will be completed first.

After P0 is complete its resources will be freed up, new available vector is :-

Available vector : (P0 complete)

    A   B   C   D
    5   3   2   2

P3 is the only process whose needs can be met, so P3 is completed next.
After P3 is complete the new available vector is :-

Available vector : (P0,P3 complete)

    A   B   C   D
    6   6   3   4

Now the system has enough available resources to satisfy any of the remaining
processes, we will go in numerical order, so P4 next :-

Available vector : (P0,P3,P4 complete)

    A   B   C   D
    7   10  6   6

P1 is next :-

Available vector : (P0,P3,P4,P1 complete)

    A   B   C   D
    10  11  8   7

Finally P2 is completed :-

Available vector : (P0,P3,P4,P1,P2 complete)

    A   B   C   D
    12  12  8   10

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Conclusion :-

Yes, the system is in a safe state since the processes can be completed with the
available resources.

One possible order is : P0 -> P3 -> P4 -> P1 -> P2

P0 is completed 1st, and P3 2nd, then the other processes can be completed in any order.
So there are in total 6 possible orders.

P0 -> P3 -> Pi -> Pj -> Pk

where i,j,k belong to {1, 2, 4} and i!=j, j!=k, k!=i
